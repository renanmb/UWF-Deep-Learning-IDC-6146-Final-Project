# TAO Tutorials

This docs needs work, Nvidia docs and githubs do not seem to have up to date and code that runs.

This code requires installing TAO on a Linux machine, there are issues with the Drivers and Containers not recognizing the nvidia-container-toolkit, Devcontainer has issues with Docker-in-Docker and Docker-outside-Docker not being able to run properly.

Need further work

NVIDIA TAO, is a python based AI toolkit that is built on TensorFlow and PyTorch for computer vision applications. It simplifies and accelerates the model training process by abstracting away the complexity of AI models and the underlying deep learning framework.
You can use the power of transfer learning to fine-tune NVIDIA pretrained models with your own data and optimize the model for inference throughput â€” all without the need for AI expertise or large training datasets.

### <a name='RecommendedHardwarerequirements'></a>Recommended Hardware requirements

The following system configuration is recommended to achieve reasonable training performance with TAO and supported models provided:

* 16 GB system RAM
* 16 GB of GPU RAM
* 8 core CPU
* 1 NVIDIA GPU
* 100 GB of SSD space

TAO is supported on discrete GPUs, such as H100, A100, A40, A30, A2, A16, A100x, A30x, V100, T4, Titan-RTX and Quadro-RTX.

> Note: TAO is not supported on GPU's before the Pascal generation

The `tao_tutorials` repository is broadly classified into two components:

* **setup:** A set of quick start scripts to help you install and deploy the TAO launcher and the TAO APIs on various
  Cloud Service Providers.
* **notebooks:** Beginner friendly end-to-end tutorial notebooks that will help you hit the ground running with TAO. The notebooks
  install TAO, download the required data, and run TAO commands end-to-end for various use cases.

  These notebooks are split into three categories:

   * `tao_api_starter_kit`: End-to-end notebooks that help you learn the features supported by the TAO API model of execution.
      The notebooks under the `api` directory work directly at the REST API level using REST API requests, while the `client` directory
      uses the TAO Client CLI to interact with the API server.
   * `tao_launcher_starter_kit`: Sample notebooks that walk you through the end-to-end workflow for all the
      computer-vision models supported in TAO. You can interact with TAO using the TAO launcher CLI.
   * `tao_data_services`: Sample notebooks that walk you through the end-to-end workflow of the different
      dataset manipulation and annotation tools that are included as part of TAO.
